Package vellum is a library for building, serializing and executing an FST (finite
state transducer).

There are two distinct phases, building an FST and using it.

When building an FST, you insert keys ([]byte) and their associated value
(uint64). Insert operations MUST be done in lexicographic order.  While
building the FST, data is streamed to an underlying Writer. At the conclusion
of building, you MUST call Close() on the builder.

After completion of the build phase, you can either Open() the FST if you
serialized it to disk.  Alternatively, if you already have the bytes in
memory, you can use Load().  By default, Open() will use mmap to avoid loading
the entire file into memory.

Once the FST is ready, you can use the Contains() method to see if a keys is
in the FST.  You can use the Get() method to see if a key is in the FST and
retrieve it's associated value.  And, you can use the Iterator method to
enumerate key/value pairs within a specified range.
